135- It was November. Alt-
hough it was not y-
et late, the sky w-
as dark when I tur-
ned into Laundress
Passage. Father had
finished for the day,
143- switched off the sho-
p lights and close-
d the shutters; bu-
t so I would not c-
ome home to darkne-
ss he had left on
the light over the s-
tairs to the
140- flat. Through the gl-
ass in the door it
cast a foolscap rec-
tangle of paleness
onto the wet paveme-
nt, and it was whi-
le I was standing
in that
141- rectangle, about to
turn my key in the d-
oor, that I first
saw the letter. Anot-
her white rectangl-
e, it was on the f-
ifth step from the
bottom,
26- where I couldn't mis-
s it.
1- 
142- I closed the door an-
d put the shop key
in its usual place
behind Bailey's Adva-
nced Principles of
Geometry. Poor Bail-
ey. No one has wan-
ted his
136- fat gray book for th-
irty years. Someti-
mes I wonder what
he makes of his role
as guardian of the
bookshop keys. I don-
't suppose it's the
77- destiny he had in mi-
nd for the masterw-
ork that he spent
two decades writing.
1- 
142- A letter. For me. Th-
at was something o-
f an event. The cr-
isp-cornered envel-
ope, puffed up wit-
h its thickly fold-
ed contents, was a-
ddressed in a
137- hand that must have
given the postman a
certain amount of tr-
ouble. Although th-
e style of the wri-
ting was old-fashi-
oned, with its heavily
140- embellished capitals
and curly flourishe-
s, my first impres-
sion was that it h-
ad been written by
a child. The letter-
s seemed untrained-
. Their
142- uneven strokes eithe-
r faded into nothi-
ng or were heavily
etched into the pap-
er. There was no s-
ense of flow in th-
e letters that spe-
lled out my
143- name. Each had been
undertaken separatel-
y -- M A R G A R E
T L E A -- as a new
and daunting enterp-
rise. But I knew n-
o children. That i-
s when I
39- thought, It is the h-
and of an invalid.
1- 
143- It gave me a queer f-
eeling. Yesterday
or the day before, w-
hile I had been go-
ing about my busin-
ess, quietly and i-
n private, some un-
known person
142- -- some stranger --
had gone to the trou-
ble of marking my
name onto this envel-
ope. Who was it wh-
o had had his mind-
's eye on me while
I hadn't
19- suspected a thing?
1- 
141- Still in my coat and
hat, I sank onto th-
e stair to read th-
e letter. (I never
read without making
sure I am in a secu-
re position. I hav-
e been
137- like this ever since
the age of seven wh-
en, sitting on a h-
igh wall and readi-
ng The Water Babie-
s, I was so seduce-
d by the descriptions of
142- underwater life that
I unconsciously rel-
axed my muscles. I-
nstead of being he-
ld buoyant by the
water that so vividl-
y surrounded me in
my mind,
124- I plummeted to the g-
round and knocked
myself out. I can st-
ill feel the scar
under my fringe now.
Reading can be dang-
erous.)
1- 
132- I opened the letter
and pulled out a she-
af of half a dozen
pages, all written
in the same laboriou-
s script. Thanks t-
o my work, I am
142- experienced in the r-
eading of difficul-
t manuscripts. The-
re is no great sec-
ret to it. Patienc-
e and practice are
all that is require-
d. That and
141- the willingness to c-
ultivate an inner
eye. When you read a
manuscript that has
been damaged by wat-
er, fire, light or
just the passing of
the
143- years, your eye need-
s to study not jus-
t the shape of the
letters but other m-
arks of production-
. The speed of the
pen. The pressure o-
f the hand
143- on the page. Breaks
and releases in the
flow. You must relax-
. Think of nothing-
. Until you wake i-
nto a dream where
you are at once a pe-
n flying
134- over vellum and the
vellum itself with t-
he touch of ink ti-
ckling your surfac-
e. Then you can re-
ad it. The intenti-
on of the writer, his
142- thoughts, his hesita-
tions, his longing-
s and his meaning.
You can read as cle-
arly as if you wer-
e the very candlel-
ight illuminating
the page as
24- the pen speeds over
it.
1- 
143- Not that this letter
was anything like a-
s challenging as s-
ome. It began with
a curt "Miss Lea";
thereafter the hiero-
glyphs resolved th-
emselves
53- quickly into charact-
ers, then words, t-
hen sentences.
1- 
21- This is what I read:-

1- 
143-     I once did an in-
terview for the Ba-
nbury Herald. I mu-
st look it out one
of these days, for
the biography. Stran-
ge chap they sent
me. A boy,
143-     really. As tall
as a man, but with t-
he puppy fat of yo-
uth. Awkward in hi-
s new suit. The su-
it was brown and u-
gly and meant for
a much older
141-     man. The collar,
the cut, the fabric-
, all wrong. It wa-
s the kind of thin-
g a mother might b-
uy for a boy leavi-
ng school for his
first job,
141-     imagining that h-
er child will some-
how grow into it.
But boys do not leav-
e their boyhood be-
hind when they lea-
ve off their schoo-
l uniform.
1- 
118-     There was someth-
ing in his manner.
An intensity. The m-
oment I set eyes o-
n him, I thought,
"Aha, what's he after?"
1- 
142-     I've nothing aga-
inst people who lo-
ve truth. Apart fr-
om the fact that t-
hey make dull comp-
anions. Just so lo-
ng as they don't s-
tart on about
134-     storytelling and
honesty, the way so-
me of them do. Nat-
urally that annoys
me. But provided th-
ey leave me alone,
I won't hurt them.
1- 
139-     My gripe is not
with lovers of the t-
ruth but with trut-
h herself. What su-
ccor, what consola-
tion is there in t-
ruth, compared to a story?
141-     What good is tru-
th, at midnight, i-
n the dark, when t-
he wind is roaring
like a bear in the
chimney? When the li-
ghtning strikes sh-
adows on
143-     the bedroom wall
and the rain taps a-
t the window with
its long fingernails-
? No. When fear an-
d cold make a stat-
ue of you in your
bed, don't
142-     expect hard-bone-
d and fleshless tr-
uth to come runnin-
g to your aid. Wha-
t you need are the
plump comforts of a
story. The soothing-
, rocking
21-     safety of a lie.-

1- 
139-     Some writers don-
't like interviews
of course. They get
cross about it. "Sa-
me old questions,"
they complain. Well-
, what do they expect?
142-     Reporters are ha-
cks. We writers ar-
e the real thing.
Just because they al-
ways ask the same
questions, it doesn'-
t mean we have to
give them
139-     the same old ans-
wers, does it? I m-
ean, making things
up, it's what we do
for a living. So I
give dozens of inter-
views a year. Hundreds
141-     over the course
of a lifetime. For I
have never believed
that genius needs t-
o be locked away o-
ut of sight to thr-
ive. My genius is
not so
77-     frail a thing th-
at it cowers from
the dirty fingers of
the newspapermen.
1- 
140-     In the early yea-
rs they used to tr-
y to catch me out.
They would do resea-
rch, come along wi-
th a little piece
of truth concealed i-
n their
141-     pocket, draw it
out at an opportune
moment and hope to s-
tartle me into rev-
ealing more. I had
to be careful. Inch
them in the directi-
on I
135-     wanted them to t-
ake, use my bait t-
o draw them gently-
, imperceptibly, t-
oward a prettier s-
tory than the one
they had their eye on. A
143-     delicate operati-
on. Their eyes wou-
ld start to shine,
and their grasp on
the little chip of t-
ruth would loosen,
until it dropped fr-
om their
132-     hand and fell, d-
isregarded, by the
wayside. It never f-
ailed. A good stor-
y is always more d-
azzling than a bro-
ken piece of truth.
1- 
139-     Afterward, once
I became famous, the
Vida Winter intervi-
ew became a sort o-
f rite of passage
for journalists. The-
y knew roughly what to
133-     expect, would ha-
ve been disappoint-
ed to leave withou-
t the story. A qui-
ck run through the
normal questions (W-
here do you get your
143-     inspiration? Are
your characters bas-
ed on real people?
How much of your ma-
in character is yo-
u?) and the shorte-
r my answers the b-
etter they
140-     liked it. (Insid-
e my head. No. Non-
e.) Then, the bit
they were waiting fo-
r, the thing they
had really come for.
A dreamy, expectant
look
130-     stole across the-
ir faces. They wer-
e like little chil-
dren at bedtime. A-
nd you, Miss Winte-
r, they said. Tell
me about yourself.
1- 
138-     And I told. Simp-
le little stories
really, not much to
them. Just a few str-
ands, woven togeth-
er in a pretty pat-
tern, a memorable motif
139-     here, a couple o-
f sequins there. M-
ere scraps from th-
e bottom of my rag-
bag. Hundreds more
where they came fro-
m. Offcuts from novels and
141-     stories, plots t-
hat never got fini-
shed, stillborn ch-
aracters, pictures-
que locations I ne-
ver found a use fo-
r. Odds and ends t-
hat fell out
135-     in the editing.
Then it's just a mat-
ter of neatening t-
he edges, stitchin-
g in the ends, and
it's done. Another
brand-new biography.
1- 
136-     They went away h-
appy, clutching th-
eir notebooks in t-
heir paws like chi-
ldren with sweets
at the end of a birt-
hday party. It would be
97-     something to tel-
l their grandchild-
ren. "One day I me-
t Vida Winter, and
she told me a story."
1- 
138-     Anyway, the boy
from the Banbury Her-
ald. He said, "Mis-
s Winter, tell me
the truth." Now, wha-
t kind of appeal i-
s that? I've had people
138-     devise all kinds
of stratagems to tr-
ick me into tellin-
g, and I can spot
them a mile off, but
that? Laughable. I
mean, whatever did he
12-     expect?
1- 
139-     A good question.
What did he expect?
His eyes were glist-
ening with an inte-
nt fever. He watch-
ed me so closely.
Seeking. Probing. He was
143-     after something
quite specific, I wa-
s sure of it. His
forehead was damp wi-
th perspiration. P-
erhaps he was sick-
ening for somethin-
g. Tell me
24-     the truth, he sa-
id.
1- 
140-     I felt a strange
sensation inside. L-
ike the past comin-
g to life. The wat-
ery stirring of a
previous life turnin-
g in my belly, cre-
ating a
125-     tide that rose i-
n my veins and sen-
t cool wavelets to
lap at my temples.
The ghastly exciteme-
nt of it. Tell me
the truth.
1- 
141-     I considered his
request. I turned i-
t over in my mind,
weighed up the like-
ly consequences. H-
e disturbed me, th-
is boy, with his p-
ale face
26-     and his burning
eyes.
1- 
25-     "All right," I s-
aid.
1- 
86-     An hour later he
was gone. A faint,
absentminded good-by-
e and no backward
glance.
1- 
141-     I didn't tell hi-
m the truth. How c-
ould I? I told him
a story. An impover-
ished, malnourishe-
d little thing. No
sparkle, no sequins-
, just a
137-     few dull and fad-
ed patches, roughl-
y tacked together
with the edges left
frayed. The kind of
story that looks lik-
e real life. Or what
142-     people imagine r-
eal life to be, wh-
ich is something r-
ather different. I-
t's not easy for s-
omeone of my talen-
t to produce a sto-
ry like that.
1- 
142-     I watched him fr-
om the window. He
shuffled away up the
street, shoulders d-
rooping, head bowe-
d, each step a wea-
ry effort. All tha-
t energy,
129-     the charge, the
verve, gone. I had k-
illed it. Not that
I take all the blam-
e. He should have
known better than to
believe me.
1- 
27-     I never saw him
again.
1- 
142-     That feeling I h-
ad, the current in
my stomach, my temp-
les, my fingertips
-- it remained with
me for quite a whil-
e. It rose and fel-
l, with
143-     the memory of th-
e boy's words. Tel-
l me the truth. "N-
o," I said. Over a-
nd over again. "No-
." But it wouldn't
be still. It was a
distraction.
143-     More than that,
it was a danger. In
the end I did a deal-
. "Not yet." It si-
ghed, it fidgeted,
but eventually it f-
ell quiet. So quie-
t that I
32-     as good as forgo-
t about it.
1- 
112-     What a long time
ago that was. Thirt-
y years? Forty? Mo-
re, perhaps. Time
passes more quickly
than you think.
1- 
136-     The boy has been
on my mind lately.
Tell me the truth. A-
nd lately I have f-
elt again that str-
ange inner stirrin-
g. There is something
140-     growing inside m-
e, dividing and mu-
ltiplying. I can f-
eel it, in my stom-
ach, round and har-
d, about the size
of a grapefruit. It
sucks the
139-     air out of my lu-
ngs and gnaws the
marrow from my bones-
. The long dormanc-
y has changed it.
From being a meek an-
d biddable thing, it has
136-     become a bully.
It refuses all negot-
iation, blocks dis-
cussion, insists o-
n its rights. It w-
on't take no for a-
n answer. The truth, it
140-     echoes, calling
after the boy, watch-
ing his departing
back. And then it tu-
rns to me, tighten-
s its grip on my i-
nnards, gives a tw-
ist. We
27-     made a deal, rem-
ember?
1- 
16-     It is time.
1- 
104-     Come on Monday.
I will send a car to
meet you from the h-
alf past four arri-
val at Harrogate S-
tation.
1- 
16-     Vida Winter
1- 
137- How long did I sit o-
n the stairs after
reading the letter?
I don't know. For I
was spellbound. The-
re is something ab-
out words. In expert
138- hands, manipulated d-
eftly, they take y-
ou prisoner. Wind
themselves around yo-
ur limbs like spid-
er silk, and when
you are so enthralled you
142- cannot move, they pi-
erce your skin, en-
ter your blood, nu-
mb your thoughts.
Inside you they work
their magic. When I
at last woke up to
myself,
113- I could only guess w-
hat had been going
on in the darkness
of my unconsciousnes-
s. What had the le-
tter done to me?
1- 
134- I knew very little a-
bout Vida Winter.
I was aware naturall-
y of the various e-
pithets that usual-
ly came attached t-
o her name: England's
142- best-loved writer; o-
ur century's Dicke-
ns; the world's mo-
st famous living a-
uthor; and so on.
I knew of course tha-
t she was popular,
though the
136- figures, when I late-
r researched them,
still came as a sur-
prise. Fifty-six b-
ooks published in
fifty-six years; the-
y are translated into
140- forty-nine languages-
; Miss Winter has
been named twenty-se-
ven times the most
borrowed author fro-
m English librarie-
s; nineteen featur-
e films
139- have been based on h-
er novels. In term-
s of statistics, t-
he most disputed q-
uestion is this: H-
as she or has she
not sold more books than the
138- Bible? The difficult-
y comes less from
working out how many
books she has sold
(an ever-changing fi-
gure in the millio-
ns) than in obtaining
141- solid figures for th-
e Bible -- whateve-
r one thinks of th-
e word of God, his
sales data are noto-
riously unreliable-
. The figure that
might have
136- interested me the mo-
st, as I sat there
at the bottom of th-
e stairs, was twen-
ty-two. This was t-
he number of biogr-
aphers who, for want of
137- information, or lack
of encouragement, o-
r after inducement-
s or threats from
Miss Winter herself,
had been persuaded
to give up trying to
142- discover the truth a-
bout her. But I kn-
ew none of this th-
en. I knew only on-
e statistic, and i-
t was one that see-
med relevant: How
many books by
45- Vida Winter had I, M-
argaret Lea, read?
None.
1- 
142- I shivered on the st-
airs, yawned and s-
tretched. Returnin-
g to myself, I fou-
nd that my thought-
s had been rearran-
ged in my absence.
Two items in
105- particular had been
selected out of the
unheeded detritus th-
at is my memory an-
d placed for my at-
tention.
1- 
141- The first was a litt-
le scene involving
my father. A box of
books we are unpack-
ing from a private
library clearance i-
ncludes a number o-
f Vida
140- Winters. At the shop
we don't deal in co-
ntemporary fiction-
. "I'll take them
to the charity shop
in my lunch hour," I
say, and leave them
on
142- the side of the desk-
. But before the m-
orning is out, thr-
ee of the four boo-
ks are gone. Sold.
One to a priest, on-
e to a cartographe-
r, one to a
142- military historian.
Our clients' faces,
with the customary o-
utward paleness an-
d inner glow of th-
e book lover, seem
to light up when th-
ey spot
141- the rich colors of t-
he paperback cover-
s. After lunch, wh-
en we have finishe-
d the unpacking an-
d the cataloging a-
nd the shelving an-
d we have no
142- customers, we sit re-
ading as usual. It
is late autumn, it
is raining and the w-
indows have misted
up. In the backgrou-
nd is the hiss of
the gas
116- heater; we hear the
sound without hearin-
g it for, side by
side, together and m-
iles apart, we are
deep in our books.
1- 
38- "Shall I make tea?"
I ask, surfacing.
1- 
11- No answer.
1- 
63- I make tea all the s-
ame and put a cup
next to him on the d-
esk.
1- 
141- An hour later the un-
touched tea is col-
d. I make a fresh
pot and put another
steaming cup beside
him on the desk. He
is oblivious to my e-
very
10- movement.
1- 
140- Gently I tilt the vo-
lume in his hands
so that I can see th-
e cover. It is the
fourth Vida Winter.
I return the book t-
o its original pos-
ition
107- and study my father'-
s face. He cannot
hear me. He cannot s-
ee me. He is in an-
other world, and I
am a ghost.
1- 
27- That was the first m-
emory.
1- 
143- The second is an ima-
ge. In three-quart-
er profile, carved
massively out of li-
ght and shade, a f-
ace towers over th-
e commuters who wa-
it, stunted,
141- beneath. It is only
an advertising photo-
graph pasted on a
billboard in a railw-
ay station, but to
my mind's eye it ha-
s the impassive gr-
andeur
142- of long-forgotten qu-
eens and deities c-
arved into rock fa-
ces by ancient civ-
ilizations. To con-
template the exqui-
site arc of the ey-
e; the broad,
137- smooth sweep of the
cheekbones; the impe-
ccable line and pr-
oportions of the n-
ose, is to marvel
that the randomness
of human variation can
139- produce something so
supernaturally perf-
ect as this. Such
bones, discovered by
the archaeologists
of the future, would
seem an artifact, a
142- product not of blunt-
-tooled nature but
of the very peak of
artistic endeavor.
The skin that embell-
ishes these remark-
able bones has the
opaque
139- luminosity of alabas-
ter; it appears pa-
ler still by contr-
ast with the elabo-
rate twists and co-
ils of copper hair
that are arranged with such
68- precision about the
fine temples and dow-
n the strong, eleg-
ant neck.
1- 
141- As if this extravaga-
nt beauty were not
enough, there are t-
he eyes. Intensifi-
ed by some photogr-
aphic sleight of h-
and to an inhuman
green, the
130- green of glass in a
church window, or of
emeralds or of boil-
ed sweets, they ga-
ze out over the he-
ads of the commute-
rs with perfect
142- inexpression. I can'-
t say whether the
other travelers that
day felt the same w-
ay as I about the
picture; they had re-
ad the books, so t-
hey may
143- have had a different
perspective on thin-
gs. But for me, lo-
oking into the lar-
ge green eyes, I c-
ould not help bein-
g reminded of that
commonplace
139- expression about the
eyes being the gate-
way to the soul. T-
his woman, I remem-
ber thinking, as I
gazed at her green,
unseeing eyes, does not
13- have a soul.
1- 
140- Such was, on the nig-
ht of the letter,
the extent of my kno-
wledge about Vida
Winter. It was not m-
uch. Though on ref-
lection perhaps it
was as
139- much as anyone else
might know. For alth-
ough everyone knew
Vida Winter -- knew
her name, knew her
face, knew her books
-- at the same time
90- nobody knew her. As
famous for her secre-
ts as for her stor-
ies, she was a per-
fect mystery.
1- 
140- Now, if the letter w-
as to be believed,
Vida Winter wanted
to tell the truth ab-
out herself. This
was curious enough i-
n itself, but curi-
ouser
65- still was my next th-
ought: Why should
she want to tell it
to me?
