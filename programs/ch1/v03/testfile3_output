102- It was November. Alt-
hough it was not y-
et late, the sky w-
as dark when I tur-
ned into Laundress
Passage.
102- Father had finished
for the day, switche-
d off the shop lig-
hts and closed the
shutters; but so I
would
101- not come home to dar-
kness he had left
on the light over th-
e stairs to the fl-
at. Through the gl-
ass in
105- the door it cast a f-
oolscap rectangle
of paleness onto the
wet pavement, and i-
t was while I was
standing
107- in that rectangle, a-
bout to turn my ke-
y in the door, tha-
t I first saw the
letter. Another whit-
e rectangle,
68- it was on the fifth
step from the bottom-
, where I couldn't
miss it.
