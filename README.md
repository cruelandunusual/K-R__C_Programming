These are my c files from working through __*The C Programming Language*__ By Kernighan & Ritchie (usually called __*K&R*__).  

I've worked through this book several times now, at least the first few chapters.  

There's always something new to learn, and despite its age and the fact that C is [pretty arcane](https://www.ioccc.org/) compared to most modern languages it's probably one of the best programming books I've read.  It doesn't hold your hand, the pace and difficulty ramping feel appropriate, and it doesn't take 500 pages to say what can be said in just over 200.   

These are the files from my most recent (partial) run through - several years ago now, although this repository has only recently been created.
