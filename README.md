These are my c files from working through "The C Programming Language" By Kernighan & Ritchie (usually called K&R).

I've worked through this book several times now, at least the first few chapters.

There's always something new to learn, and despite its age and the fact that C is a little arcane compared to most modern languages it's probably one of the best programming books I've read.

These are the files from my last run through - several years ago now, even though this repository has only recently been created.
